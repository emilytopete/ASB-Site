However, we strongly encourage parents to schedule athletic physicals for June or July so that the expiration date aligns with the school year. This would result in your son/daughter being cleared for the entire year of sports.</p>

                    <h3>Concussion Protocol</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Sweetwater Union High School District places student safety as our number one priority.
                             In the unfortunate situation when a student suffers a concussion we immediately implement
                             our Return to Learn Protocol in the classroom and our Return to Play Protocol if a student
                             is involved in our athletic programs. Parents need to communicate with their student’s coach,
                             nurse, athletic trainer, and counselor after meeting with the doctor. A doctor’s note will
                             assist in guiding us in accommodating your student’s needs. The nurse and counselor will
                             then inform your students teachers and begin to monitor your student’s progress as
                             established by our Return to Learn Protocol. Teachers will work with your student and
                             make accommodations based upon his/her progress. If symptoms have a prolonged effect
                             on your student’s classroom performance, a student study team may be necessary.
